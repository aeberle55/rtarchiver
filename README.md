## Script instructions
The raw python scripts can be run by anyone with Python2.7 installed on their computer. They require the package BeautifulSoup4, installation instructions for which can be found [here](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup). Run the `archive_gui.py` script to use the GUI. You can also run `scrape_forum.py` to scrape a forum from the CLI or `scrape_user.py` for journals or images.
